> Warning! This library is in development and currently does not adhere to SemVer until we hit v2.0, so, expect breaking changes!

## Features
* Generic abstraction for [Radians{T}](https://github.com/GasInfinity/Rena.Mathematics/blob/main/Rena.Mathematics/Radians{T}.cs) and [Degrees{T}](https://github.com/GasInfinity/Rena.Mathematics/blob/main/Rena.Mathematics/Degrees{T}.cs)
* Multiple generic vector types like [Vec2{T}](https://github.com/GasInfinity/Rena.Mathematics/blob/main/Rena.Mathematics/Vectors/Vec2{T}.cs) and [Vec3{T}](https://github.com/GasInfinity/Rena.Mathematics/blob/main/Rena.Mathematics/Vectors/Vec3{T}.cs)
* Multiple generic matrix types like [Mat4x4{T}](https://github.com/GasInfinity/Rena.Mathematics/blob/main/Rena.Mathematics/Matrices/Mat4x4{T}.cs)
* High-performance SIMD optimizations where applicable

## Why use this library instead of System.Numerics?
* This library uses generic math so you're not limited to only `System.Single`
* Tries be as optimized as possible with SIMD instructions thanks to `System.Runtime.Intrinsics` and the new `Unsafe.BitCast` of .NET 8 üöÄ
  * In this moment Vec3 does not have SIMD support implemented
  * This library can't do magic, the JIT its what does all the work for us. The generated assembly of the JIT is partially optimal for [Vec4{T}](https://github.com/GasInfinity/Rena.Mathematics/blob/main/Rena.Mathematics/Vectors/Vec4{T}.cs) in win-x64 and win-x86, other types or RID's may not be as optimal as they should be ‚úèÔ∏è
## When to stick with System.Numerics
* When you only need Vectors with `System.Single`. Those vectors are handled specially by the runtime so you won't have any problem with them, so, unless we have something specific you need, you don't need Rena.Mathematics
* When you can't update to _.NET 8_ (This limitiation is a temporal measure)

## TODO's
- [ ] Support .NET 7 without SIMD? (We don't have Unsafe.BitCast there, so, conditional compilation...)
- [ ] Finish [Quat{T}](https://github.com/GasInfinity/Rena.Mathematics/blob/main/Rena.Mathematics/Quat{T}.cs) implementation 
- [ ] Add all the remaining MatMxN types
- [ ] [Vec3{T}](https://github.com/GasInfinity/Rena.Mathematics/blob/main/Rena.Mathematics/Vectors/Vec3{T}.cs) SIMD
- [ ] v2.0
